# Know It ...

This is a Flask Application which consists of three different prediction codes. 

Firstly, the **Pizza Liking Prediction** tells whether a person will like pizza or not. It uses the knn which is **K-Nearest Neighbors** model to learn the pizza.csv dataset provided to predict the possibility of whether a particular person will like pizza or not.

The next is **Fuel Price Prediction** which is about the cost of the fuel depending upon the distance travelled. It uses the **Linear Regression** model as the target variable IS continous in nature.

Finally, the **Diabetes Prediction** yeilds the output classifying if that particular person will have diabetes or not. **Logistic Regression** is used in this case.

This project wraps everything into one Flask application with HTML and CSS for styling and designing the web page.
